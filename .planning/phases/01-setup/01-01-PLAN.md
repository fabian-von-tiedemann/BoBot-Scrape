<objective>
Set up Python environment with Playwright dependency for browser automation.

Purpose: Establish the Python project structure and install the Playwright library needed for CDP connection.
Output: Working Python environment with Playwright installed and ready to use.

**Tech stack:**
- Python 3.11+ (modern async support, type hints)
- Playwright (browser automation with CDP support)

**Constraints:**
- Use pyproject.toml (modern Python packaging)
- Keep dependencies minimal (only what's needed)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Python project configuration</name>
  <files>pyproject.toml, .python-version</files>
  <action>
Create pyproject.toml with:
- Project name: bobot-scrape
- Python requirement: >=3.11
- Dependencies: playwright
- Basic project metadata

Create .python-version file with "3.11" for pyenv/asdf compatibility.

Keep it minimal - no dev dependencies, no optional extras, just what's needed.
  </action>
  <verify>cat pyproject.toml shows valid TOML with playwright dependency</verify>
  <done>pyproject.toml exists with playwright dependency, .python-version specifies 3.11</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Install dependencies and Playwright browsers</name>
  <files>-</files>
  <action>
1. Create virtual environment: python3 -m venv .venv
2. Install project: .venv/bin/pip install -e .
3. Install Playwright Chromium browser: .venv/bin/playwright install chromium

Note: Only install chromium (not all browsers) since we only need Chrome/Chromium support for CDP.
  </action>
  <verify>.venv/bin/python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; print('OK')" prints OK</verify>
  <done>Virtual environment created, playwright importable, chromium browser installed</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] pyproject.toml exists and is valid TOML
- [ ] .venv directory exists with Python
- [ ] `playwright` can be imported from .venv Python
- [ ] Chromium browser is installed for Playwright
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- Python environment ready for CDP script development
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-setup/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
